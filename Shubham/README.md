# Image_Super_Resolution_SoC

The goal of this project is to develop an image super-resolution system using deep neural networks. The system will take in a low-resolution image as input and output a high-resolution image with enhanced details. The project will involve designing and training various DNN architectures, experimenting with different loss functions and optimization strategies, and evaluating the performance of the system using quantitative and qualitative metrics.

This project can be done google collab.
